Dashboard to visualize the percentage of stories shipped by themes

# Purpose

Consumer Data squad works on stories belonging to different themes. In addition, the desire is to manage the split of the feature-custodianship-techdebt in the range of 70-20-10. The dashboard is an attempt to visualize the actual split of stories by categories and themes.

# Stories

As a consumer data team member
I want to retrieve the list of all the stories in Shipped column
So that I can list the stories categorized by themes (i.e. "Content Based Recommendations", "Tech Debt" etc.)

As a consumer data team member 
I want to view the percentage split of stories by themes
So that I can compare the actual split to the desired split
